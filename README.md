# tree-sitter-teika

Teika grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).

The grammar is based on the Menhir grammar present on the [teika repository](https://github.com/teikalang/teika/blob/main/syntax/cparser.mly). Since both tree-sitter and Menhir are LR(1) parsers, the translation is almost mechanical and it should be easy to keep the parser up to date with the repo.
